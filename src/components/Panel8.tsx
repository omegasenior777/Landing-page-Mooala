                    <h2>About Mooala</h2>
                    <p>Mooala was founded with the goal of making USDA-organic plant-based milks more accessible and affordable to U.S. households. Our beverages are USDA-organic and made with good ingredients like real, organic bananas and organic coconut cream.
                       <br/> <br />We believe goodness should flow deeper than the beverages themselves, which is why we support non-profit micro finance organizations in developing countries. These groups provide entrepreneurs and economies with a “hand up” - not a hand out - and provide tremendous support to communities in need. A portion of all of our profits to support these organizations.
                       <br/> <br />Thanks for helping us spread the love.</p><br/>
